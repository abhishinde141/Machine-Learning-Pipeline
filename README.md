# Machine-Learning-Pipeline-and-Hyperparameter-Tuning

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline that preprocesses both numerical and categorical data, integrates these preprocessing steps using a `ColumnTransformer`, and then trains a regression model. The pipeline is further optimized by tuning hyperparameters using `RandomizedSearchCV`.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

### Numerical Data Preprocessing
- **StandardScaler**: Standardizes numerical features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This ensures that all numerical features contribute equally to the model.
- **SimpleImputer**: Handles missing values in numerical features using a strategy like mean imputation, where missing values are replaced by the mean of the column.

### Categorical Data Preprocessing
- **OneHotEncoder**: Transforms categorical features into a one-hot encoded format, converting categories into binary vectors, which can be used by the model.

### Combining Preprocessors with ColumnTransformer
- **ColumnTransformer**: Allows different preprocessing steps to be applied to different subsets of the data. The numerical and categorical transformers are combined into a single preprocessing pipeline.

## 3. Building the Pipeline

- **Pipeline Construction**: The `Pipeline` object is constructed by combining the `ColumnTransformer` with a regression model (e.g., `RandomForestRegressor`, `LinearRegression`, etc.). This creates a single pipeline that handles both data preprocessing and model training in one go.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

- **RandomizedSearchCV**: Used to find the best hyperparameters for the model. Unlike `GridSearchCV`, which tests all possible combinations, `RandomizedSearchCV` randomly samples a specified number of combinations, which is more efficient when dealing with large parameter spaces.
- The search process includes cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## 5. Final Pipeline

- **Final Model Selection**: After finding the best set of hyperparameters, the final pipeline is trained on the entire training dataset using these optimal parameters.
- The resulting model is ready for predictions on new data.

## 6. Results and Evaluation

The notebook likely concludes with an evaluation of the model's performance, possibly including metrics like RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess how well the model is performing.

## Summary

This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to building and tuning a machine learning model by seamlessly integrating preprocessing steps for both numerical and categorical data into a single pipeline. The use of `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning ensures that the model is optimized efficiently, leading to better performance on regression tasks.
